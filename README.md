# Arduino simwheel

I had a Thrustmaster T150 wheel with a fried motherboard.

I thought: I had the electronics already, so why wouldn't I resurrect my old wheel and have some fun?

To do this yourself, you need:
- An Arduino Leonardo/Pro Micro (or something with an Atmega32u4 processor)
- A simulator wheel with a force feedback motor & encoder.
- A motor driver (I used a BTS7960)
- Patience

The correct Arduino code is in `arduino-simwheel` directory.

This was a really fun challenge.

T150 wiring and pinouts are in `T150-wiring.md`.
